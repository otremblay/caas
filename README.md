caas (Clock As A Service)
=========================

Easy peasy, dude. Just run this, and HTTP GET it to have a UTC time and date sent back to you.

GET /America/New_York to get the time in new york! Vary with any time zone in the IANA time zone DB!

That's it, dude!

go get github.com/otremblay/caas to install!
